## Python Higher Order Functions & Event Listeners

In order to be able to listen to what the user does, like pressing a button, we will use 
event listeners. We will pass functions as inputs like `function_a(function_b)`. This 
is called **Higher Order Function**, **a function that receives another function and 
work with it inside its body**. In this case, it is recommended we use **Keyword Arguments**, 
instead of positional arguments, when dealing with functions that we didn't crate.<br>

## Object state and instances

Classes are blueprints. We can take the class and construct a bunch of objects from it. 
We can create as many objects as we need. Each will be a separate instance. Each object 
can have a unique state (attributes and methods).

## Turtle race

Here we applied our newly acquired knowledge to a project.
