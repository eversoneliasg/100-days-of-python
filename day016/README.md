## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP alows us to reuse functionalities and deal with more complex programs.<br>
For this, we will work with classes and objects.<br><br>
Imagine yourself as a manager of a restaurant responsible for dealing with a waiter, a cooker and a receptionist.
You have to think of what a waiter has (`is_holding_plate = True`) and what it does (`def take_order(table, order)`).
Attributes are what the waiter has, while methods are what he does.<br><br>
To access the attribute, we can type use the following structure: `waiter.is_holding_plate`. Methods can
be accessed with the same dot notation, like `waiter.take_order()`.

## Python Packages

Packages are a bunch of code that other people have written to reach a goal.
For interesting packages, visit: https://pypi.org/ <br>
To install a package, go to File > Settings > [Chose Your Project] > Python Interpreter > + <br>

We must achieve the same goal we achieved yesterday, but with the classes provided.
