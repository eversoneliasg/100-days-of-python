## The Python Dictionary

How dictionaries work.

## Grading Program Exercise
You have access to a database of `student_scores` in the format of a dictionary. The **keys** in `student_scores` are the **names** of the students and the **values** are their exam **scores**. <br>
Write a program that **converts their scores to grades**. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called `student_grades` that should contain student **names** for **keys** and their **grades** for **values**. **The final version** of the `student_grades` dictionary will be checked. <br>
