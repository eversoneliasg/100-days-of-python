## Day 13 - Debugging material

Techniques to quickly be able to identify and remove bugs!

1) Describe the problem: think about what the code should be doing.
2) Reproduce the bug.
3) "Play computer": trying to think as a computer can help us in a lot of moments.
4) Fix the errors.
5) Print is your friend!
6) Use a debugger. This is a more complex tool.
7) Take a break. Keep looking at the code won't work. Things can get easier later.
8) Ask a friend (not the print :P) to look through your code.
9) Run often. Run your code often, don't wait to run it after a ton of changes.
10) Ask StackOverflow: ask relevant questions.
