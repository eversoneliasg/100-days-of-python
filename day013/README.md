Debugging: techniques to quickly be able to identify and remove bugs!

1) Describe the problem: think about what the code should be doing.

2) Reproduce the bug.

3) "Play computer": trying to think as a computer can help us in a lot of moments.

4) Fix the errors.

5) Print is your friend!

6) Use a debugger. This is a more complex tool.

7) Take a break. Keep looking at the code won't work. Things can get easier later.

8) Ask a friend (not the print :P) to look through your code.

9) Run often. Run your code often, don't wait to run it after a ton of changes.

10) Ask StackOverflow: ask relevant questions.
